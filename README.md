# PacMan-Game
This is a simple PacMan game implementation using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. It allows players to control PacMan and navigate through a maze, collecting points and avoiding ghosts. The game is built using basic game development concepts and can serve as a starting point for learning game development or experimenting with game mechanics.
